## What I Learned

In this project, I focused on using CSS custom properties for colors and layout options, allowing easy theming and adjustments across the project. I also applied Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts and handling different screen sizes, and used the
selector to define and organize my color variables globally.

## Hereâ€™s a snippet of CSS for setting up reusable color variables:

## css

## :root {

# --color-bright-orange: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);

# --color-dark-cyan: hsl(184, 100%, 22%);

# --color-very-dark-cyan: hsl(179, 100%, 13%);

# --color-paragraphs: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);

# --color-background-headings-buttons: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);

# }

# Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to continue focusing on:

Advanced CSS layouts using CSS Grid and more complex media queries for responsive design.
Improving accessibility and ARIA support.
Implementing animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
Useful Resources
